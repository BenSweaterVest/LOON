# LOON Documentation Index

Use this as the single entry point for project documentation.

## Start Here
- Installation and first-run setup: `README.md`
- Day-to-day operations: `OPERATIONS.md`
- Local mode usage: `docs/LOCAL_MODE.md`
- Browser-only diagnostics screen: `/admin/setup-check`

## Reference Docs
- API reference: `docs/API.md`
- Passkey user guide: `docs/PASSKEYS_GUIDE.md`
- Security policy and controls: `SECURITY.md`
- Architecture overview: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Contributor workflow: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Documentation Scope Rules
- `README.md`: fastest successful install path and high-level usage
- `OPERATIONS.md`: production admin runbook and troubleshooting
- `docs/API.md`: endpoint contracts and status/error behavior
- `SECURITY.md`: policy, controls, and threat model summary

If content belongs to one of these scopes, update that canonical doc instead of creating a new one-off file.
