# LOON Passkey User Guide

WebAuthn/FIDO2 authentication guide for LOON.

## What Are Passkeys

Passkeys let you sign in without typing a password. Your device verifies your identity using built-in security such as biometrics or a security key. Passkeys are resistant to phishing and replay attacks.

## Set Up Your First Passkey

1. Sign in to the admin panel with your username and password.
2. Open Settings, then Security.
3. In the Passkeys section, select Add Passkey.
4. Name the device and complete the browser prompt.
5. Save the recovery codes shown after registration.

## Log In with a Passkey

1. On the login screen, select Login with Passkey.
2. If prompted, enter your username.
3. Complete the device prompt to authenticate.

If you cannot use a passkey, select Can't use passkey and enter a recovery code.

## Manage Passkeys

- View: Settings, Security, Passkeys.
- Rename: Select the edit control next to a passkey.
- Delete: Select the delete control next to a passkey.

Keep at least one passkey registered so you can always sign in.

## Recovery Codes

- Use a recovery code when you cannot use a passkey.
- Codes are single-use and do not expire.
- You can regenerate codes from Settings, Security.

## Troubleshooting

- Login fails: Update the browser, then retry.
- Device missing: Re-register the device or use a recovery code.
- Lost recovery codes: If you can sign in, regenerate codes; otherwise contact an admin.

## Security Best Practices

- Store recovery codes in a secure location.
- Register more than one device.
